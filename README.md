# Landing Page

A React landing page for a fictional adventure travel company. This is not intended to be a full website, just the landing page so none of the buttons and links do anything (unless they are links to other sections of the page). 

I chose to use React to create this landing page as I could break down the various sections of this website into smaller components, and re-use these where required (such as the tour cards). 

I created the logo used for this website as part of a Adobe PhotoShop Daily Creative Challenge I completed in 2020. The Behance project can be found here: [Behance Project Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/99486457/Photoshop-DCC-22nd-June-to-26th-June-2020)

## Issues I encountered

This landing page features alot of photographs and images which can impact performance. I needed to resize these to be the smallest file size possible whilst still being high enough quality to look good on the website. 

I wanted to ensure that this website looked good on both desktop and mobile devices, so had to change the layout accordingly. I wrote the CSS to be mobile-first, which involved having a hamburger menu and a basic column layout for the Destinations and Tour Cards. I then scaled this up to use drop-down menus and photo grids for larger screens.  

## Photographs and Icon Attributions

The Social Media Icons are taken from Simple Icons. The chevrons and arrows used in the slideshow and dropdown menus are Google Material Design icons. 

The photographs used in this website were either taken by myself or were taken from Pixabay or Unsplash.

The photographs of Petra (Jordan card), Macchu Picchu (Peru card), the elephant (Kenya card) and Peles Castle (Romania tour card) were taken by myself and copyright applies to these.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
