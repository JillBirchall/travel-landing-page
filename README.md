# Landing Page

A React landing page for a fictional adventure travel company. This is not intended to be a full website, just the landing page so none of the buttons and links do anything (unless they are links to other sections of the page).

I chose to use React to create this landing page as I could break down the various sections of this website into smaller components, and re-use these where required (such as the tour cards).

I created the logo used for this website as part of a Adobe PhotoShop Daily Creative Challenge I completed in 2020. The Behance project can be found here: [Behance Project Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/99486457/Photoshop-DCC-22nd-June-to-26th-June-2020)

## Issues I encountered

This landing page features alot of photographs and images which can impact performance. I needed to resize these to be the smallest file size possible whilst still being high enough quality to look good on the website.

I wanted to ensure that this website looked good on both desktop and mobile devices, so had to change the layout accordingly. I wrote the CSS to be mobile-first, which involved having a hamburger menu and a basic column layout for the Destinations and Tour Cards. I then scaled this up to use drop-down menus and photo grids for larger screens.

## Photographs and Icon Attributions
